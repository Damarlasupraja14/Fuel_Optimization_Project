# üöõ Logistics Fuel Efficiency Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

This real-world project focuses on analyzing logistics data involving trucks, freight, and fuel to identify inefficiencies and reduce fuel costs. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, the aim was to help optimize operations in a data-driven way.

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (MySQL)
- **Power BI** (Interactive dashboard and insights)
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The project is based on 3 datasets:

1. **Dimensions**  
   - `DriverID`: Unique ID of the driver  
   - `DriverName`: Name of the driver  

2. **Freight**  
   - `Date`: Delivery date  
   - `CustomerID`: ID of the customer  
   - `TruckID`: Truck used  
   - `InvoiceNumber`: Unique invoice  
   - `FreightID`: Freight identifier  
   - `City`: Delivery location  
   - `NetRevenue`: Revenue from delivery  
   - `Weight(kg)`: Weight of the shipment in kilograms  
   - `Weight(cubic)`: Volume of the shipment  
   - `GoodsValue`: Total value of the shipped goods  

3. **Fuel Costs (fcosts)**  
   - `Date`: Date of operation  
   - `TruckID`: Vehicle identifier  
   - `DriverID`: Driver associated  
   - `Fuel`: Fuel cost  
   - `KM Travelled`: Distance covered  
   - `Litres`: Fuel used  
   - `FixedCosts`, `Maintenance`: Additional costs

## üéØ Objective

To identify key patterns and suggestions that help reduce fuel costs and improve the logistics efficiency of trucks and drivers.

---

## üîç Key Analysis Performed

- Merged and cleaned datasets using Python
- Calculated **Fuel Efficiency = KM Travelled / Litres**
- Identified trucks and drivers with poor fuel efficiency
- Tracked **Revenue by City**, **Goods Weight**, and **Fuel Usage**
- Found actionable insights that can reduce fuel expenses by **~15%**

---
## SQL Integration
   To enable robust data querying and filtering, I imported the cleaned datasets into a MySQL database and performed several analytical queries to derive meaningful insights.

**Key Highlights:**
 - Created relational tables for Drivers, Fuel Costs, and Freight Deliveries.

 - Joined multiple tables using JOIN operations to analyze:

 - Fuel efficiency per truck and driver

 - Revenue by delivery city

 - High-cost maintenance patterns

  Used SQL to pre-aggregate data before visualizing in Power BI.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

**Dashboard Highlights:**
- Net Revenue by City
- Fuel Efficiency by Truck & Driver
- Weight & Revenue correlation
- Monthly trends
- Interactive filters by city, truck, and drive

## üí° Insights & Recommendations

1. **Low Efficiency Trucks**: Specific trucks consumed more fuel per km. Recommend maintenance or replacement.
2. **Driver Training**: Variance in driver performance suggests training could improve fuel usage.
3. **City Routes**: Some cities consistently showed low revenue-to-cost ratios. Consider rerouting or repricing.
4. **Cost Reduction**: Addressing 3 inefficiencies could reduce fuel costs by **up to 15%**.
